. **Predicting Housing Prices**:
   - **Objective**: The goal is to predict the price of a house based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, location, etc.
   - **Dataset**: You can use publicly available datasets like the Boston Housing Dataset or web scraping to gather housing data.
   - **Approach**: Start by exploring and preprocessing the data, which may involve handling missing values, scaling features, etc. Then, split the data into training and testing sets. Next, choose a regression algorithm like Linear Regression and train the model on the training data. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error or Root Mean Squared Error on the test data. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve performance.
